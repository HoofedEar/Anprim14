PrimitiveStation is a fork of Space Station 14.
An entirely self contained station that houses a primitive society. No electricity, computers or machines. They must survive off of the flora, hunt wild animals, make tools, and survive. Will they work together, or splinter into gangs fighting for territory? Nanotrasen has provided this experiment with a near infinite budget, thus ensuring the station will forever have itâ€™s own working atmosphere and gravity. The Syndicate has no knowledge of the location of this station. But, watch out for Blood Cultists.
